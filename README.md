Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.*  

### Problem Statement:  
*As a result of Danny's love for food, he decides to embark on a risky venture and invest in a restaurant that serves his favorite meals: Sushi,Ramen and Curry. He has data from a few months of Operation and wants to use it to answer a few questions about the customers especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite .*

2.How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

## [CASE STUDY #2 : PIZZA RUNNER.](https://github.com/Abhilash17br/SQL-Data-Exploration-Data-Cleaning/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%232%20-%20Pizza%20Runner.sql)

### Introduction:  
*Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway…)  
Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”  
Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!  
Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.*  

### Problem Statement:  
*Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.  
He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.  
All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions*

### Case Study Questions
1.How many pizzas were ordered?  
2.How many unique customer orders were made?  
3.How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

9.What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?  
10.What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
